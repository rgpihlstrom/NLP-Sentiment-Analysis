### List of Major Questions
- **1. How To Best Uses Bayes and or RF - Word2vec or TF-idf **  
I creates a word emdidding vector for my LSTM model.  Do I use the word embedding vector for MNB and RF?   Not finding a lot of examples where they use wordemedding with simple ML?
- 
-   **2.  Standadzing/ nomralizing the vectors? Is it necessary? ***
If so, not sure how to perform, would I just use standard scaler on my vectors?

- **3.  Tunning my Models***
Right now all of my models need tunning.
  Bayes - Overfittingranging from Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boost, Ada, and XGBoost.  Ultimately, I decided to use <b><ins>Knn, Decision Trees and Random Forest</ins></b> , as these classifiers are non-parametric and are highly interpretable.  Interpretability, the disproportionate number of categorical features, along with being able to avoid addressing multicollinearity were the most influential factors in selecting which classifiers to imp
